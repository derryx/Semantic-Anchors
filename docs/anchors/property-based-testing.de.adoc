====
*Auch bekannt als*: Generative Testing, QuickCheck-style Testing

*Kernkonzepte*:

* *Properties*: Invariants that should always hold
* *Generators*: Automatic test data creation
* *Shrinking*: Minimizing failing test cases to simplest form
* *Universal quantification*: Testing "for all inputs"
* *Specification testing*: Testing high-level properties, not examples
* *Edge case discovery*: Finds cases you didn't think of
* *Complementary to example-based*: Works alongside traditional unit tests
* *Stateful testing*: Testing sequences of operations
* *Model-based testing*: Compare implementation against simpler model

*Key Tools*: QuickCheck (Haskell), Hypothesis (Python), fast-check (JavaScript), FsCheck (.NET)

*Wann zu verwenden*:

* Testing pure functions and algorithms
* Validating business rules and invariants
* Testing parsers and serializers
* Finding edge cases in complex logic
* Complementing example-based TDD
